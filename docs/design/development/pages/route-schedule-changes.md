# Rescheduling and acknowledgement centre — design contract

Stable entry: `route:/schedule/changes`. Owner: Dean Fiedler. Status: **Draft for visual review**.

## S1–S5 native implementation

Page type: **Work queue + persistent detail**. Canonical destination: `/schedule/changes`. Source authority: [PPO-SCHED-ADR](../../../decisions/scheduling-resources-architecture.md).

1. Select the period, timezone and site, then Needs review, Change requests, Customer follow-up, Cancellations or History / all visits.
2. Select the exact appointment. Compare current versus requested interval, crew roles, explicit travel allowances/reasons and schedule/request versions.
3. Enter a decision reason and use existing Accept and check move, Reject request or Cancel request where permitted. Acceptance reruns booking guards; pending requests reserve nothing.
4. Open appointment controls for move/reassignment, customer contact or cancellation. Review owned follow-up, booking history and contact events separately.

An exact appointment handover stays visible even outside the selected date/queue. Changed booking facts require fresh contact and preparation review. Contact is not delivery or pack acknowledgement.

## Desktop

Toolbar wraps; PL-04 queue and comparison sit beside the exact record. PL-03/PL-05 use readable evidence cards.

## Mobile

Stack filters, queue/detail and current/proposed sections; preserve words, UUID context and reachable actions. The shared shell owns vertical scrolling. Use 1440 × 960, 1024 × 768, 390 × 844, 320 CSS px and 200% zoom for review.

Reuse: current shell, business-ui Field/SelectField/ReadState/Stamp, Button/ButtonLink, existing PlannerBoard and RequestDecision controls. Incoming: current scoped source/version evidence. Outgoing: existing owning-domain commands and exact PL-04 handovers; scenarios do not mutate.

The retained Scheduling r01 HTML is a proposed reference; newer authorised work-order demand and current appointment states govern application behaviour.

[Executed evidence and remaining review](../../../testing/evidence/scheduling-resources/README.md). Application images are pending until that index identifies inspected captures. No review fingerprint or owner acceptance is created by this edit.
