# Appointment detail — design reference

Stable entry: `route:/service/appointments/[id]`. Owner: Dean Fiedler. Status: **Owner visual review 9 October 2026: Refine**.
Source baseline: `ccc2251bbba9df266cac9027ddaa9418ab9abc1d`. Application destination: `/service/appointments/{id}`.
This is an editable working specification. Existing accepted page baselines take precedence over these proposed common-layout rules. A blank review record is not approval.

## Purpose and task

This page address exists in the inspected application source. Open it from a running app using an identity with the required access.

1. Confirm the record reference and customer/site context in this record workspace.
2. Review the proposed visit and its contact/readiness evidence
3. Confirm available crew through the scheduling workflow
4. Track changes and individual acknowledgement

## Desktop

Use the application shell for navigation, search, identity and the existing information icon. Keep the page title, selected record/scope and primary action visible. Use a register/worklist for multiple records and a record/evidence workspace for an individual record. Match the linked page-specific reference where one exists; retain its accepted geometry.

At 1440 × 960 and 1024 × 768, inspect the complete shell and stylesheet order. Let long titles and unknown values wrap. Keep one owner for content scrolling. Record the actual dimensions and any approved adaptation here after paired source/application review.

## Mobile

At 390 × 844 and 320 CSS px, retain the same task and record context. Stack related fields and use labelled cards for dense worklists. Keep primary actions, validation and the close control reachable. Inputs use readable 16 px text; touch controls use the shared minimum target. Do not hide a required decision or critical state solely to fit the screen.

The exact mobile composition has not been visually accepted for this entry. Retain mobile-specific evidence here when reviewed; a desktop image is not mobile evidence.

## Shared components and states

Use the global Roboto/Verdana typography and semantic tokens. Reuse the shared Button component for new controls; preserve documented existing page-specific exceptions until deliberately migrated. Use consistent primary/secondary/quiet/danger meanings. Include hover, visible focus, disabled and loading states.

Review loading, empty, filtered-empty, read-only/denied, missing context, validation error, stale revision, saving, uncertain result and success where the workflow supports them. Status must include words, not colour alone. Preserve a draft when opening guidance or inspecting a reference.

## Visual references

No exact image or HTML reference is linked. Keep this gap visible.

## Behaviour, handovers and verification

The draft User Guide `guide.page.service.appointments.id` carries prerequisites, tasks, outcomes and recovery. Review that article against the running release before publication. Keep source presence, visual review, functional testing, owner acceptance and deployment separate.

Acceptance evidence is pending. Capture matching original-reference and application views, then verify keyboard order, focus return, 200% zoom, wrapping, scroll ownership, phone states and the relevant business journey. Do not replace a comparison image simply to make a test pass.

## Canonical Job Pack handover

JobPackEntry reuses shared buttons and ReadState. The current server read chooses Open job pack or permitted Prepare job pack with the exact appointment identity. No visible pack is distinct from a denied read (access-unavailable status) and a failed request (shared error alert). Refresh hides prior links; no denial grants access. Desktop/phone text wraps and 44 px controls remain within the existing panel or trapped drawer. [I5 handover](../../../delivery/job-pack-integration-handover.md) records evidence; the existing appointment/booking authority is unchanged.

## Scheduling Step 4 integration

Preserve this entry's scope ID and page type. Reuse shared fields, Button, ReadState/ErrorNotice and existing appointment/planner controls. Incoming handovers: exact published selection, immutable impact, retained booking pin and owned Activity. Outgoing handovers: controlled appointment/resolution receipt and refreshed readiness; customer, pack, Finance and issued documents retain their separate authority.

Desktop must show the impact reason, responsible owner, source publication and permitted next action. Booking preparation follows the proposed interval and publication head, including future policies; stale saves retain entries and need fresh review. Completing an Activity or acknowledging a pack cannot clear the policy hold. Later source changes restore it. The appointment's online resolution disclosure requires controlled change/cancellation/replacement and fresh evaluation. Uncertain responses retry the original unchanged.

At 390/320 px, stack fields/actions, wrap exact identifiers and keep hold/recovery text readable without horizontal overflow. Retain keyboard alternatives to drag and native disclosure/label semantics. Delayed offline Start is rechecked on reconnect and may remain ReviewRequired with original evidence retained. Publication and resolution are online only. No Step 4 issued mockup is available; the existing retained HTML remains the source reference. Additional content is a proposed visual departure pending owner review. Functional evidence: `docs/testing/evidence/scheduling-policy-enforcement/README.md`; captures and source checks do not grant visual/device/owner acceptance.

Automatic policy preparation must show failures without moving focus out of a date being edited. Save stays unavailable until complete preparation succeeds; explicit command errors retain normal focus and recovery.


## Closed-visit guidance — 3 October 2026

Existing scope IDs and r20 page type remain: My Jobs uses **Register / worklist**; the job, work-order and appointment hosts use **Record detail**. No new route. Incoming context is the exact appointment, current assignment, scope and personal attendance; outgoing handovers use the existing Service work-order planned visits and appointment records. A link grants no preparation, booking, capture or technical authority.

A closed appointment shows retained personal attendance identity/times when present, otherwise explicitly says no personal arrival exists. CompletedPendingReview, Completed and Cancelled cannot offer another arrival. Stopped timer, frozen evidence, internal Service acceptance and customer response stay distinct. Proposed is not booked; unknown states are unavailable. Other visits on the same work order are scoped navigation, not inferred return lineage. The receiving appointment shows incomplete preparation versus Preparing and retains separate customer, assignment, readiness and exact-pack requirements.

Reuse ButtonLink, ReadState, ErrorNotice, Stamp, the existing booking-operation recovery and timer host. Current-source read failure removes receiving links and disables arrival/pack actions without destroying pending originals. Downloaded context strips these live actions; cached closed visits cannot create new arrival intent, while retained operations remain on their original visit. Work-order proposal validation/stale errors retain input; an uncertain response keeps the immutable original and prevents another submission until adjudicated.

Desktop 1440/1024 and phone 390/320: retain one content scroll owner, readable wrapping identifiers/history and labelled actions. Keyboard users can follow the work-order/appointment links; recovery continuation is focusable. Inspect actual 200% browser zoom independently of narrow viewports. Accepted timer r05 remains unchanged; this contextual host addition is proposed for owner review. **No accepted native closed-visit mockup exists.** Implementation captures are functional/layout observations, not visual acceptance.

See [state/action decision](../../../decisions/field-closed-visit-guidance.md), [acceptance matrix](../../../testing/field-closed-visit-acceptance.md) and [execution ledger](../../../testing/evidence/field-closed-visit/README.md). Owner, physical-device, screen-reader and independent visual reviews remain open.

## Owner visual review — 9 October 2026

- **Reviewer:** Dean Fiedler. He accepted Claude's proposed verdicts from the phase 00 review boards (navigation canvas version 29).
- **Result:** Refine.
- **Evidence:** [phase 00 review, session 1](../../../testing/evidence/ui-review-phase-00-r01/README.md). Synthetic data; compiled build at `a52cb01`; 1440 × 900 and 390 × 844 headless Chromium, captures for this entry.
- **Findings:** The action buttons touch the 'Current crew' heading; add the standard section gap. S5 and S6.
- **Scope of this record:** visual review of the captured state only. Device, screen-reader, zoom and operational acceptance remain separate. A later source change marks this review stale.
