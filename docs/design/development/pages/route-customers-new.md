# Create customer / shared record — design reference

Stable entry: `route:/customers/new`. Owner: Dean Fiedler. Status: **Draft for visual review**.
Source baseline: `ccc2251bbba9df266cac9027ddaa9418ab9abc1d`. Application destination: `/customers/new`.
This is an editable working specification. Existing accepted page baselines take precedence over these proposed common-layout rules. A blank review record is not approval.

## Purpose and task

An app page exists here. Its wider workspace scope or newer design still needs refinement; see the linked scope areas below.

1. Search the related register for an existing record before creating another.
2. Complete the information requested by the creation form; keep unknown values explicit.
3. Review the entered context, save through the page action and inspect the resulting record/confirmation.
4. Then continue the wider workflow: Follow linked records to review relationship history

## Desktop

Use the application shell for navigation, search, identity and the existing information icon. Keep the page title, selected record/scope and primary action visible. Use a register/worklist for multiple records and a record/evidence workspace for an individual record. Match the linked page-specific reference where one exists; retain its accepted geometry.

At 1440 × 960 and 1024 × 768, inspect the complete shell and stylesheet order. Let long titles and unknown values wrap. Keep one owner for content scrolling. Record the actual dimensions and any approved adaptation here after paired source/application review.

## Mobile

At 390 × 844 and 320 CSS px, retain the same task and record context. Stack related fields and use labelled cards for dense worklists. Keep primary actions, validation and the close control reachable. Inputs use readable 16 px text; touch controls use the shared minimum target. Do not hide a required decision or critical state solely to fit the screen.

The exact mobile composition has not been visually accepted for this entry. Retain mobile-specific evidence here when reviewed; a desktop image is not mobile evidence.

## Shared components and states

Use the global Roboto/Verdana typography and semantic tokens. Reuse the shared Button component for new controls; preserve documented existing page-specific exceptions until deliberately migrated. Use consistent primary/secondary/quiet/danger meanings. Include hover, visible focus, disabled and loading states.

Review loading, empty, filtered-empty, read-only/denied, missing context, validation error, stale revision, saving, uncertain result and success where the workflow supports them. Status must include words, not colour alone. Preserve a draft when opening guidance or inspecting a reference.

## Behaviour, handovers and verification

The draft User Guide `guide.page.customers.new` carries prerequisites, tasks, outcomes and recovery. Review that article against the running release before publication. Keep source presence, visual review, functional testing, owner acceptance and deployment separate.

Acceptance evidence is pending. Capture matching original-reference and application views, then verify keyboard order, focus return, 200% zoom, wrapping, scroll ownership, phone states and the relevant business journey. Do not replace a comparison image simply to make a test pass.

## Customer resolution and owned transfer (LC-12)

Manual enquiry capture remains distinct from current customer resolution. Select permitted customer/site/contact identities or use the native shared record form and return. Each shared creation is saved separately; a contact then needs its explicit dated affiliation. A return only preselects the new identity: review and save the Lead resolution with a reason. Earlier selections and captured facts remain retained. Conversion uses the latest saved selection.

The current active Lead owner may transfer accountability to an eligible existing owner after comparing all linked Activities. Keep original Activity owners, due dates, outcomes and links. Show a clear no-recipient state and prevent submission without a valid selection. Recover uncertain saves with the original operation, including after ownership changes. No default permission is added.

Reuse the existing Lead modal, LookupField, TextArea, shared Field/SelectField/ValidationFields, native dates and existing save-recovery hook. The existing legacy lead-primary/secondary and shared capture form layout are retained as explicit exceptions; no new shared component is introduced. Incoming: captured Lead and permitted shared customer records. Outgoing: immutable resolution or owned transfer, then the explicit LC-11 conversion handover. This remains the existing r20 Record workspace/page type and scope.

Desktop: keep captured/current context headings distinct, long record names wrapping, comparison in the scroll body and Save/Confirm original save in the reachable footer. Phone: stack the same required choices and reasons at 390 and 320 CSS px; never conceal missing affiliation, denied recipient or uncertain save. Creation routes remain native full-page forms with an explicit return to the Lead. Keyboard selection is separate from free text.

Exact new resolution/transfer/create-return mockup images are missing. Retained Leads reference: `docs/reference/ui/crm/PPO-Leads-Desktop-Container-r01.html`; shared customer reference: `docs/reference/ui/customers/PPO-Customer-360-Workspace-r01.html`. These additive states are proposed adaptations under the existing scope, pending paired visual and owner review. No fingerprint is adopted. See [customer-context decision](../../../decisions/lead-customer-context.md) and [synthetic state examples](../lead-continuity-fixtures.json).

Local functional checks and limited capture inspection are retained in [LC-12 execution evidence](../../../testing/evidence/lead-context-resolution/README.md). Paired source, owner and physical-device review remain pending.
