# Project initiation and receiving review — design reference

Stable entry: `scope:PJ-01`. Owner: Dean Fiedler. Status: **Draft for visual review**.
Source baseline: `ccc2251bbba9df266cac9027ddaa9418ab9abc1d`. Application destination: `/projects/new`.
This is an editable working specification. Existing accepted page baselines take precedence over these proposed common-layout rules. A blank review record is not approval.

## Purpose and task

Extend project creation with accepted commercial scope, receiving review, owned assumptions and return/rework.

1. Review the incoming commitment and source revision
2. Identify missing information or return reasons
3. Create or accept the bounded project context through permitted controls

## Desktop

Use the application shell for navigation, search, identity and the existing information icon. Keep the page title, selected record/scope and primary action visible. Use a register/worklist for multiple records and a record/evidence workspace for an individual record. Match the linked page-specific reference where one exists; retain its accepted geometry.

At 1440 × 960 and 1024 × 768, inspect the complete shell and stylesheet order. Let long titles and unknown values wrap. Keep one owner for content scrolling. Record the actual dimensions and any approved adaptation here after paired source/application review.

## Mobile

At 390 × 844 and 320 CSS px, retain the same task and record context. Stack related fields and use labelled cards for dense worklists. Keep primary actions, validation and the close control reachable. Inputs use readable 16 px text; touch controls use the shared minimum target. Do not hide a required decision or critical state solely to fit the screen.

The exact mobile composition has not been visually accepted for this entry. Retain mobile-specific evidence here when reviewed; a desktop image is not mobile evidence.

## Shared components and states

Use the global Roboto/Verdana typography and semantic tokens. Reuse the shared Button component for new controls; preserve documented existing page-specific exceptions until deliberately migrated. Use consistent primary/secondary/quiet/danger meanings. Include hover, visible focus, disabled and loading states.

Review loading, empty, filtered-empty, read-only/denied, missing context, validation error, stale revision, saving, uncertain result and success where the workflow supports them. Status must include words, not colour alone. Preserve a draft when opening guidance or inspecting a reference.

## Visual references

No exact image or HTML reference is linked. Keep this gap visible.

## Behaviour, handovers and verification

The draft User Guide `guide.pj.01` carries prerequisites, tasks, outcomes and recovery. Review that article against the running release before publication. Keep source presence, visual review, functional testing, owner acceptance and deployment separate.

Acceptance evidence is pending. Capture matching original-reference and application views, then verify keyboard order, focus return, 200% zoom, wrapping, scroll ownership, phone states and the relevant business journey. Do not replace a comparison image simply to make a test pass.


## Native Won receiving (LC-16)

Keep this existing scope and page type. Incoming handover: exact accepted Won Sales event; outgoing: independently created native Project or Service work order and a separately reviewed typed binding. The Deal reads native receiving state and the retained Activity separately. It does not infer delivery completion from acceptance, a link or an Authorised work order.

Reuse shared Button, Field, SelectField, ErrorNotice, recoverable command journal, existing native lookup controls and record guard. Preserve the native Project Gantt and Service scope/readiness layouts. Proposed addition: a scoped Sales-context panel, explicit fixed-version comparison and create-and-return actions. Existing native form buttons remain documented legacy controls; no new theme or navigation system is introduced.

Desktop and phone: wrap reported scope and references; show original Sales revision beside current native state, owner and version. Keep Review, link reason, discard and original-recovery actions visible in normal document flow. A refresh must not silently substitute a reviewed comparison. Denied comparison reads remove its protected content. Unknown Sales site requires an explicit native site choice and does not rewrite the accepted source. New Service intake and work-order creation save independently before link review; existing native scope and authorisation controls remain.

Exact new-state mockup/HTML images are missing. Retained module references above are baseline context. Implementation captures and synthetic checks are recorded in `docs/testing/evidence/won-delivery-continuity/README.md`; they do not grant paired visual, keyboard/200% zoom, physical-device or owner acceptance. Review fingerprints remain unchanged.

Project host refinement: open **Sales handovers** to read this context in the existing native-dialog pattern. Keep the fixed Gantt workspace intact; close/Escape returns to the originating action. Initial sibling-panel phone failure is retained in the execution evidence.
