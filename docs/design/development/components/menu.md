# Menus and selection popovers

<!-- versioning: git; committed history is authoritative -->

**Owner:** Dean Fiedler · **Catalogue key:** `menu` · **Review:** Pending

Actual WorklistChoice and WorklistMenu with selected state and keyboard operation.

## Source and reference

Design: [ppo-deal-pipeline_r38.html](../../../reference/ui/deals/ppo-deal-pipeline_r38.html). Retained design reference; paired acceptance not recorded.

The application implementation and exact consumer bindings are maintained in `../components.json`. The live catalogue links the current checkout and computes dependency fingerprints.

## Desktop

Open with the trigger; arrows/Home/End move through choices; Escape returns focus.

## Mobile

Popover stays within viewport bounds and closes through selection or dismissal.

## Keyboard and accessibility

Tab/Shift+Tab and visible focus throughout. Use arrows/Home/End in tabs or menus; Escape dismisses overlays.

## States and interaction

- **Default:** Representative synthetic content and normal interaction.

## Differences and limits

Native popover support is required by the current runtime. Touch and assistive-technology review remain separate.

## Verification and maintenance

Review at 1440 × 960, 1024 × 768, 820 × 800, 390 × 844 and 320 × 700 where relevant; check browser zoom and keyboard operation separately. Compare the same state and viewport with the retained reference. Record exact commit, reviewer, date, fixture state, viewport, result and evidence paths in the component review record. Automated source fingerprints do not grant acceptance.

Changes to the source, styles, fixtures, specification or reference invalidate prior evidence. Update this master and its component record in the same pull request. Keep app business checks separate from catalogue presentation checks.

## Projects Figma consumer

`route:/projects` reuses this component with scoped styling from `src/app/styles/projects-register.css`. [Decision](../../../decisions/projects-register-native.md) and [source measurements](../../projects-register/figma-measurements.json) define the requested departures: 40 px desktop rows/header and controls, pinned 44 px end cells, compact 80 px phone rows, a 240 px expanded rail and a five-item Projects phone bar. Generic consumer geometry remains intact. Native fixture/state examples are in `tests/browser/projects-register.spec.ts` (selection, export, exact snapshots, URL restoration and refused reads); this does not introduce a new isolated gallery renderer.

Use the [execution record](../../../testing/evidence/projects-register/README.md) for actual checks and visual limitations. Owner/device review stays pending; no review fingerprint is assigned by this update.
