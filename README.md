# Powerplants One

Private prototype of an integrated business operations platform for Powerplants Australia, covering CRM, estimating, engineering, projects, service, supply chain and finance.

**Owner:** Dean Fiedler (`deanrfiedler-gif`) · **Stage:** prototype definition and architecture package prepared · **Deployment:** none.

This repository is Dean's personal private prototype. It contains the planning foundation, source references and development backlog. It does not yet contain a runnable business application. Company ownership, production approval and external-system write authority are not implied.

| [Current project status](docs/STATUS.md) | What exists, what remains planned and how recent user decisions relate to the issued blueprint |
| [Master Blueprint — working r03](docs/blueprints/BP-01-master-blueprint.md) | Scope Assurance & Development Planning Edition: seven domains, 78 parent requirements and release contracts |
| [Documentation index](docs/README.md) | Where specifications, decisions, requirements and acceptance records belong |
| [Development backlog](docs/delivery/backlog.md) | Initial discovery/design work packages and their live GitHub issue links |
| [First-release plan](docs/delivery/first-release.md) | Proposed planned-service journey, dependencies and readiness criteria |
| [Contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md) | Branches, pull requests, validation and evidence |

## Product direction

The proposed platform connects customer relationships, scoping and quotation, design, delivery, material coordination and equipment service. The candidate first release addresses prepared job packs, technician scheduling, relevant history, field evidence and a reviewed Finance handoff.

MYOB Acumatica remains the intended authoritative ERP. SharePoint remains the intended business-document repository, subject to the actual supported configuration. Native CAD authoring remains in suitable engineering tools. Pipedrive and Smartsheet continue their current roles until an explicitly accepted transition. No integration or migration has been implemented here.

## Repository structure

| Location | Content |
|---|---|
| `docs/standards/` | Adopted naming, migration/exception registers and ChatGPT project instructions |
| `docs/blueprints/` | Stable working master and module blueprints |
| `docs/prototype/`, `docs/contracts/` | PP-01 scope/traceability and selected data/API/Finance/document contracts |
| `docs/reference/` | Historical master/audit and source-provenance manifest |
| `docs/decisions/` | Current decision register and architecture decision records |
| `docs/requirements/` | All 78 parent requirements with source/release/test linkage |
| `docs/architecture/` | BP-02 architecture recommendation, boundaries and feasibility obligations |
| `docs/testing/` | Planned acceptance catalogue and evidence standard |
| `docs/delivery/` | Backlog, first-release plan and foundation handover |
| `.github/` | Issue forms, pull-request template and documentation-check workflow |
| `scripts/` | Small repository-assurance utilities |

Application, database and deployment folders will be added during P01 implementation. The prototype architecture recommendation is recorded in ADR-0003; no application dependencies have been installed by this documentation package.

## Working checks

With Python 3 installed, run:

```sh
python3 scripts/check_foundation.py
python3 scripts/check_prototype.py
python3 scripts/check_naming.py
```

The check verifies reference hashes, register counts/IDs, local Markdown links and selected repository hygiene. It is not an application, security or business-acceptance test. The GitHub workflow runs the same check with read-only repository permissions; enforcement through branch protection is a separate account/settings matter.

Use [Issues](https://github.com/deanrfiedler-gif/powerplants-one/issues) for development work and [pull requests](https://github.com/deanrfiedler-gif/powerplants-one/pulls) for reviewable changes. The next implementation task is P01 in the [ordered prototype plan](docs/delivery/prototype-implementation-plan.md).
