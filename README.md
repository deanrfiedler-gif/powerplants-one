# Powerplants One

Private prototype of an integrated business operations platform for Powerplants Australia, covering CRM, estimating, engineering, projects, service, supply chain and finance.

**Owner:** Dean Fiedler (`deanrfiedler-gif`) · **Stage:** P02 shared data foundation implemented; final verification tracked in the handover · **Deployment:** none.

This repository is Dean's personal private prototype. It contains the planning foundation, source references and development backlog. It now contains a local synthetic application foundation; full business workflows remain planned. Company ownership, production approval and external-system write authority are not implied.

## Product direction

The proposed platform connects customer relationships, scoping and quotation, design, delivery, material coordination and equipment service. The candidate first release addresses prepared job packs, technician scheduling, relevant history, field evidence and a reviewed Finance handoff.

MYOB Acumatica remains the intended authoritative ERP. SharePoint remains the intended business-document repository, subject to the actual supported configuration. Native CAD authoring remains in suitable engineering tools. Pipedrive and Smartsheet continue their current roles until an explicitly accepted transition. No integration or migration has been implemented here.

## Repository structure

| Location | Content |
|---|---|
| `docs/standards/` | Adopted naming, migration/exception registers and ChatGPT project instructions |
| `docs/blueprints/` | Stable working master and module blueprints |
| `docs/prototype/`, `docs/contracts/` | PP-01 scope/traceability and selected data/API/Finance/document contracts |
| `docs/reference/` | Historical master/audit and source-provenance manifest |
| `docs/decisions/` | Current decision register and architecture decision records |
| `docs/requirements/` | All 78 parent requirements with source/release/test linkage |
| `docs/architecture/` | BP-02 architecture recommendation, boundaries and feasibility obligations |
| `docs/testing/` | Full acceptance catalogue, P01 component evidence and dependency inventory |
| `docs/delivery/` | Backlog, first-release plan and foundation handover |
| `.github/` | Issue forms, pull-request template, documentation and application assurance workflows |
| `scripts/` | Repository assurance, local launcher, database lifecycle and persistence proof |

Application code is in `src/`, explicit SQL migrations and fixtures are in `db/`, and runtime checks are in `tests/`. See [P02 setup, verification and handover](docs/delivery/p02-handover.md) and [ADR-0006](docs/decisions/ADR-0006-p01-local-foundation.md) for the local-only implementation and limits.

## Run the local application

Follow the [exact setup and run commands](docs/delivery/p02-handover.md#exact-install-and-fresh-setup): Node 24.20.0, npm 11.19.0, PostgreSQL 16.15, `npm ci`, ignored local configuration, migration/seed and `npm run dev`. Open `http://127.0.0.1:3000`. Production startup is intentionally refused. The handover includes test, reset and recovery commands.

## Working checks

With Python 3 installed, run:

```sh
python3 scripts/check_foundation.py
python3 scripts/check_prototype.py
python3 scripts/check_naming.py
```

The check verifies reference hashes, register counts/IDs, local Markdown links and selected repository hygiene. It is not an application, security or business-acceptance test. The GitHub workflow runs the same check with read-only repository permissions; enforcement through branch protection is a separate account/settings matter.

Use [Issues](https://github.com/deanrfiedler-gif/powerplants-one/issues) for development work and [pull requests](https://github.com/deanrfiedler-gif/powerplants-one/pulls) for reviewable changes. P01 is verified; P02 delivery and verification are recorded in its [handover](docs/delivery/p02-handover.md). P03 is the next bounded task in the [ordered prototype plan](docs/delivery/prototype-implementation-plan.md).
